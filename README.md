# OlfactometerControl
source files and documentation for control of 50-odor olfactometer prototype


1. Upload slave_A.ino to Arduino Slave A & slave_B.ino to Arduino Slave B
2. Upload master.ino to Arduino master
3. Run PIDtesting.py




notes:
- master & slave codes include config files at locations hard coded to my PC - needs to be edited by user
- slave A and slave B codes are identical except for line 8: slaveIndex
